Question: The question is super interesting and makes sense. I like how the introduction is framed.

Methodology: I think the recreation is pretty straight forward and makes sense. The only thing I'm slightly confused about is how it selects the darkest point and if that's the ending point of the string or if that's the line that's darkest in the image. For your experiment, it makes sense and it's written out nicely which was super helpful as a reader. Including variable names is sometimes helpful and I think it works for your methodology.

Results: I wish there were some images of your replication and what it looks like. I also think there could be more detail and specific examples of the drawbacks from your results. I think it could also be cool to input an image from the figure in your report to see how your algorithm compares to the algorithm that generated the images in your example picture. Overall this look in progress and I'm excited to see the end results.

Implications: Not really there yet, but I see some supporting details throughout. It's a little different because it doesn't feel like there's an argument necessarily, but I think images would be able to clarify whether or not you can really see a difference in color vs black and white.

Replication: Not sure what results look like but seems like it's in the process of coming along.

Extension: There was a mention of k-means clustering for color selection, but isn't really explained very thoroughly. I think the extension is really cool though and makes sense with the project.

Progress: Hard to tell honestly. I have no feel for how far along the project is, but it seems like it's getting there.

Presentation: Well written from what's there so far. I think there's some mechanics issues but it's not a big problem to solve.

General feedback: I think the order and structure of the report is a bit hard to follow. The annotated bibliography in the middle feels weird. It also feels like you jump from a solid intro through a high level overview of results then to a detailed write up of your experiment. It was also a little misleading to read about some of your results from the abstract and then see no evidence of it, though I'm sure that's a "it's coming" type of thing. Overall looks like it's in progress and the idea is awesome! Good job!
